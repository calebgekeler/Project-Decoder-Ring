# Project-Decoder-Ring-Algorithms

This is a series of three different algorithms used to encode and decode mesasges. The encoding is simple but demonstrates how complex algorithms can be used to manipulate data. 

You can play around with the front-end by forking and cloning then run ```npm install``` then ```npm start```.

Have fun!
